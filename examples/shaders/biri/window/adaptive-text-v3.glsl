// Adaptive text legibility v3 — no per-pixel text classification (that's what caused the
// speckle: hard per-pixel decisions flip at glyph edges). Instead, two smooth operations
// that cannot speckle because they are continuous in both space and luminance:
//   1. a wide blur of the capture estimates the BACKDROP (wallpaper through the alpha);
//   2. where that backdrop is bright, it is adaptively DIMMED (like the terminal's alpha
//      locally increasing — multiplicative, so the wallpaper keeps its hue);
//   3. the DETAIL layer (pixel minus backdrop) — glyphs, mostly — is amplified on top.
// Net effect: text keeps its exact rendered colors but sits on a locally calmer, darker
// backdrop with its own contrast boosted. Over dark wallpaper the dim fades to nothing.
//

// Tuning knobs:
//   RADIUS -> backdrop blur radius in px (bigger = smoother, softer response)
//   GAIN   -> detail amplification (1 = none; 2 = double the text-vs-backdrop contrast)
//   DIM    -> how dark a fully bright backdrop gets (0.55 = 55% of original)
//   DIMLO/DIMHI -> backdrop luminance range over which the dim ramps in
